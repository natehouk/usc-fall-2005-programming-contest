# Fall 2005 USC Programming Contest (24 September 2005)

In fall of 2005, as a rising sophomore in the USC Viterbi school of engineering, I won* the USC programming contest.

This repository is an archive of the C++ code used to solve **problem A** from the included problem set.

Also included in the files is the testing data used for testing the implemented solution.

More info about the Fall 2005 contest can be found [here](http://contest.usc.edu/index.php/Fall05/Home). The contest continues to this day and more info can be found on the project [USC Programming Contest](http://contest.usc.edu/index.php/Main/HomePage) website.

\*technically I tied for 1st place.
